# Random Walks In Goog Maps
* walker.py is a simple script that uses browser automation in order to perform a random walk in google streetview and saves the lat/lngs of each move it makes.
* plotter.py can be used to plot the points generated by walker.py
* Not very useful for now, but I think there are cool applications
